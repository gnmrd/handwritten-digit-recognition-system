# Handwritten Digit Recognition System using Multi-class Classification and Neural Networks
> Important Note: This repository includes the solution to Programming Assignment No. 3 in Stanford University's [Machine Learning course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/). Kindly refer to Coursera's Honor Code upon use.

The programs were written in GNU Octave / MATLAB programming languages.

### 1) Multi-class Classification
> Refer to ex3.m as the main program file for this method.

The regularized logistic regression was applied to one-vs-all classification and prediction with **94.9%** training accuracy.

### 2) Neural Networks
> Refer to ex3_nn.m as the main program file for this method.

Neural networks are proven to represent complex models that form non-linear hypotheses. Feedforward propagation and prediction were utilized to compute for the final hypothesis function (also denoted as g(z(3)) in this exercise). The system outputs **97.5%** training accuracy.
